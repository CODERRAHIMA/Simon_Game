# Simon says Game

A browser-based Simon memory game that shows an increasing sequence of colored tiles; the player repeats the sequence to advance levels.

**How it works:**
The app generates a random color each level and flashes the corresponding tile. The player clicks tiles to build userSeq; clicks are validated by checkAns, and levelUp advances the game or triggers game over and updates the highest score.
